# Overview

***

This is a demo app for Spring Web, JPA, JPQL, Hibernate and Thymeleaf.

# Usage

***

Build and run using Gradle. A postgres database on port 5432 is needed by default (see `application.properties`).

Running ImportDataApplication fills the database with some entries to tinker with.

The app runs on Spring Web default port (`8080`).
